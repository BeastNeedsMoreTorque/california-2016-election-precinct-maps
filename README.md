# California's most detailed election result map EVER

We're gonna make a precinct-level map of results from the 2016 General Election. And we're gonna do it within 24 hours of polls closing.

[Google Spreadsheet with current status](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_4YN6v-GzB5s8DQ7JbImkeJAqj-o3DrISaB7aS-PHHA/edit?usp=drive_web)

Probable ideas of maps
- How many people voted for Trump in your neighborhood? (idea being that California reliably will go to Clinton. So, where are the Trump supporters?)
- Who's for potting it up in California? (Okay, grandpa. Where is support for this Prop 64?)
