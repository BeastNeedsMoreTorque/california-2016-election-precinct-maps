# Colusa

Colusa was pretty straight forward. There's a parser.py file to run through and make sense of the txt statement of votes. There was one consolidation on our part: 405C is both 405 (Stonyford Prec MB 9) and 406 (Lodoga Prec MB 9) because they're together in the shapefile we received from the county.
