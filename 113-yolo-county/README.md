# Yolo

Yolo was particularly tricky. They underwent some type of staffing change and had limited resources with GIS this election. Eventually we consolidated a file from statewidedatabase.org http://statewidedatabase.org/pub/data/G14/c113/mprec_113_g14_v01_shp.zip

Because of our troubles with this county we are missing one precinct in the shapefile. It is consolidation 100132 and home precinct 340059 WEST SACRAMENTO 59. It did not appear in the statewide database file and it's location is confusing based on Yolo's interactive map.
