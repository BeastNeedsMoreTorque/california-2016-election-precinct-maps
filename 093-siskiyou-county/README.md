# Siskiyou

Siskiyou provided a KMZ file of precincts and a consolidation file, but there are two precincts missing from the KMZ/shapefile. M3055 Juniper and M5055 Oak are absent, representing about 85 votes. That's about 0.4% of all votes in the county. We'll update this if we get clarification on where those two precincts are.
