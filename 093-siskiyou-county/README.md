# Siskiyou

Siskiyou provided a KMZ file of precincts and a consolidation file, but there are two precincts missing from the KMZ/shapefile. M3055 Juniper and M5055 Oak are absent, representing about 85 votes.

County officials said, "These two precincts were created for the November election only. They were comprised of subprecincts of Grenada Precinct and Forest Mountain Precinct."

So, we consolidated Grenada and Forest Mountain with Oak and Juniper in the results and the shapefile.
